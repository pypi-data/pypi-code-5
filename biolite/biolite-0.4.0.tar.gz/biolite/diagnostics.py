"""
Diagnostics usually come in the form of plots or summary statistics.
They can serve many purposes, such as:

* diagnosing problems in sample preparation and optimizing future preparations;
* providing feedback on the sequencing itself, e.g. on read quality;
* implementing 'sanity checks' at intermediate steps of analysis;
* finding optimal parameters by comparing previous runs;
* recording computational and storage demands, and predicting future demands.

The *diagnostics* database table archives summary statistics that can be
accessed across multiple stages of a pipeline, from different pipelines, and in
HTML reports.

A diagnostics record looks like:

::

    catalog_id | run_id | entity | attribute | value | timestamp

The `entity` field acts as a namespace to prevent attribute collisions, since
the same attribute name can arise multiple times within a pipeline run.

When running a BioLite pipeline, the default entity is the pipeline name plus
the stage name, so that values can be traced to the pipeline and stage during
which they were entered. Entries in the diagnostics table can include paths to
derivative files, which can be summaries of intermediate files that are used to
generate reports or intermediate data files that serve as input to other stages
and pipelines.

Initializing
------------

Before logging to diagnostics, your script must initialize this module with a
BioLite catalog ID and a name for the run using the `init` method. This will
return a new run ID from the :ref:`runs-table`. Optionally, you can pass an
existing run ID to `init` to continue a previous run.

Diagnostics are automatically initialized by the Pipeline and IlluminaPipeline
classes in the :ref:`pipeline-module`.

Logging a record
----------------

Use the `log` function described below.

Detailed system utilization statistics, including memory high-water marks and
compute wall-time are recorded automatically (by the wrapper base class) for
any wrapper that your pipeline calls, and for the overall pipeline itself.

Provenance
----------

Because every wrapper call is automatically logged, the diagnostics table holds
a complete non-executable history of the analysis, which complements the
original scripts that were used to run the analysis. In combination, the
diagnostics table and original scripts provide provenance for all analyses.
